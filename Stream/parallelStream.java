parallelStream() is a method in Java that allows you to process a stream of data in parallel, taking advantage of multi-core processors to improve performance.

What is a Stream?
A stream is a sequence of elements that can be processed in a pipeline fashion. Streams are lazy, meaning that they only process data when necessary.

What is parallelStream()?
parallelStream() is a method that returns a parallel stream, which is a stream that can be processed in parallel. When you call parallelStream() on a collection, Java breaks the data into smaller chunks and processes each chunk concurrently using multiple threads.

How does parallelStream() work?
Here's a high-level overview of how parallelStream() works:

1. Splitting: The data is split into smaller chunks, called "splits".
2. Thread allocation: Each split is assigned to a separate thread.
3. Processing: Each thread processes its assigned split concurrently.
4. Combining: The results from each thread are combined to produce the final result.

Benefits of parallelStream()
Using parallelStream() can provide significant performance benefits, especially when working with large datasets. Some benefits include:

- Improved performance: By processing data in parallel, you can take advantage of multi-core processors to improve performance.
- Scalability: parallelStream() can handle large datasets by breaking them down into smaller chunks and processing them concurrently.

Example
Here's an example of using parallelStream() to process a large list of numbers:

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, ..., 1000000);

numbers.parallelStream()
       .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
       .map(n -> n * 2)
       .forEach(System.out::println);

In this example, the parallelStream() method is used to process the list of numbers in parallel. The filter() method is used to filter out odd numbers, the map() method is used to double the remaining numbers, and the forEach() method is used to print the results.

Note that parallelStream() is not always the best choice, especially for small datasets or datasets that require sequential processing. It's essential to understand the trade-offs and use parallelStream() judiciously.

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
public class StreamDifferenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        // Using a sequential stream
        System.out.println("Sequential Stream:");
        numbers.stream()
               .forEach(num -> System.out.println("Number " + num + " processed by " 
                       + Thread.currentThread().getName()));
        // Using a parallel stream
        System.out.println("\nParallel Stream:");
        numbers.parallelStream()
               .forEach(num -> System.out.println("Number " + num + " processed by " 
                       + Thread.currentThread().getName()));
    }
}

Sequential Stream:
Number 1 processed by main
Number 2 processed by main
Number 3 processed by main
Number 4 processed by main
Number 5 processed by main

Parallel Stream:
Number 3 processed by ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3
Number 1 processed by ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-5
Number 4 processed by ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1
Number 2 processed by ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-7
Number 5 processed by ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-2

import java.util.stream.Collectors;
public class StreamComparison {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
        // Sequential stream: Filter even numbers and square them
        List<Integer> sequentialResult = numbers.stream()
            .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
            .map(n -> n * n)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
        System.out.println("Sequential Result (Even numbers squared): " + sequentialResult);
        // Parallel stream: Filter odd numbers and cube them
        List<Integer> parallelResult = numbers.parallelStream()
            .filter(n -> n % 2 != 0)
            .map(n -> n * n * n)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
        System.out.println("Parallel Result (Odd numbers cubed): " + parallelResult);
    }
}


• Sequential Stream:
The stream processes the numbers one after another. It filters out the even numbers and squares them.
For the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], the filtered even numbers are [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], and after squaring, you get [4, 16, 36, 64, 100].
• Parallel Stream:
The parallel stream processes the numbers concurrently. It filters out the odd numbers and cubes them.
For the same list, the filtered odd numbers are [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], and cubing them produces [1, 27, 125, 343, 729].

Summary in the Context of Our Example
 
• For the sequential stream used to filter even numbers and square them:
	• The entire list is processed one element at a time.
	• Each even number is squared, reached in the list’s order, and then collected into a result list.
• For the parallel stream used to filter odd numbers and cube them:
	• The data is first partitioned so that each partition handles a subset of the numbers concurrently.
	• Each odd number is cubed within its partition.
	• Finally, the cubed results from all partitions are merged together via the collector.
 
Both techniques rely on lazily built pipelines and Spliterator-driven traversal, differing mainly in how the workload is divided and executed.
