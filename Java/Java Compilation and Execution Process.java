Java Compilation and Execution Process
 
1. Compiler and Bytecode
 
The Java compiler (javac) converts source code (.java files) to bytecode (.class files). This bytecode is platform-independent and can be created on any operating system.
 
2. JVM and Platform Dependency
 
• The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is platform-dependent, meaning different versions exist for different operating systems
• Each operating system requires its specific JVM implementation
• The JVM must be preinstalled on the operating system to execute Java bytecode
 
3. Execution Flow
 
Source Code (.java) → Compiler (javac) → Bytecode (.class) → JVM → Machine Code

 4. Platform Independence
 
The statement is correct that Java is platform-independent because:
 
• Bytecode created on one system (e.g., Windows) can be executed on any other system (e.g., Linux, macOS)
• The same bytecode works across different platforms without modification
• The JVM handles the platform-specific translation of bytecode to machine code
