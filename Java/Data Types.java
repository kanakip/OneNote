2. Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data type
Primitive Data Type: Primitive data are single values with no special capabilities. There are 8 primitive data types:
	• boolean: stores value true or false
	• byte: stores an 8-bit signed two’s complement integer
	• char: stores a single 16-bit Unicode character
	• short: stores a 16-bit signed two’s complement integer
	• int: stores a 32-bit signed two’s complement integer
	• long: stores a 64-bit two’s complement integer
	• float: stores a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point
	• double: stores a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point
Non-Primitive Data Type: Reference Data types will contain a memory address of the variable’s values because it is not able to directly store the values in the memory. Types of Non-Primitive are mentioned below:
	• Strings
	• Array
	• Class
	• Object
	• Interface
