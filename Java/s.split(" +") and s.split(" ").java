 String words[] = s.split(" +"); and  String words[] = s.split("   "); what is differeance ?

In Java, the split() method is used to divide a string into an array of substrings based on a specified delimiter.

Difference between split(" +") and split(" "):
1. split(" "):

    - Splits the string into substrings separated by a single space character.
    - If there are multiple consecutive spaces, they will be treated as separate delimiters, resulting in empty strings in the output array.

Example:

String s = "Hello   World";
String[] words = s.split(" ");
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(words));
// Output: [Hello, "", "", World]


2.  split(" +")*:

    *   Splits the string into substrings separated by one or more space characters.
    *   The + quantifier in the regular expression matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element (in this case, a space character).
    *   If there are multiple consecutive spaces, they will be treated as a single delimiter.

    Example:

String s = "Hello   World";
String[] words = s.split(" +");
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(words));
// Output: [Hello, World]


In summary:

- split(" ") splits on single spaces and treats multiple consecutive spaces as separate delimiters.
- split(" +") splits on one or more spaces and treats multiple consecutive spaces as a single delimiter.

When to use each:

- Use split(" ") when you need to preserve empty strings in the output array, such as when parsing a CSV file.
- Use split(" +") when you want to ignore multiple consecutive spaces and treat them as a single delimiter, such as when tokenizing a sentence.
