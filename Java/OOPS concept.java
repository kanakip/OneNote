What is the OOPs Concept?
Object-oriented programming is one of the fundamental concepts of programming helping developers to bind functions and data together with the help of objects and classes.
The OOPs concept in Java assists the programmers in controlling and accessing the data and implementing this to improve the readability and reusability of the code. 
In Java, every class has some objects. Every object has some methods and properties associated with it. Combining them will build the structure of object-oriented programming.
