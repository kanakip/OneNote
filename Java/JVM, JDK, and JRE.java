I'll explain JVM, JDK, and JRE with their relationships and components:
 
JDK (Java Development Kit)
 
The complete software development kit for Java programming.
 
Components of JDK:
 
1. Development Tools
• javac (compiler)
• java (interpreter)
• javadoc (documentation generator)
• debugger
2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
3. Java API Documentation
4. Java Compiler
5. Development Libraries
 
JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
 
The minimum environment required to execute Java applications.
 
Components of JRE:
 
1. Java Class Libraries
2. JVM
3. Class Loader
4. Runtime Data Areas
5. Execution Engine
 
JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
 
The runtime engine that executes Java bytecode.
 
Components of JVM:
 
1. Class Loader Subsystem
	• Loading
	• Linking
	• Initialization
2. Runtime Data Areas
	• Method Area
	• Heap
	• Stack
	• PC Registers
	• Native Method Stack
3. Execution Engine
	• Interpreter
	• JIT Compiler
	• Garbage Collector
 
Here's their relationship in a hierarchical structure:

Key Points:
 
JDK
 
	• Complete development kit
	• Includes JRE
	• Contains development tools
	• Required for Java development
 
JRE
 
	• Runtime environment
	• Includes JVM
	• Required to run Java applications
	• No development tools
 
JVM
 
	• Executes bytecode
	• Platform dependent
	• Memory management
	• Security management
 
Memory Areas in JVM:
 
1. Method Area
• Stores class structures
• Static variables
• Method data
2. Heap
• Object storage
• Garbage collection
• Shared among threads
3. Stack
• Thread-specific
• Method frames
• Local variables
4. PC Register
• Current execution position
• Per thread
5. Native Method Stack
• For native code execution
• Platform-specific code
 
Execution Flow:

Source Code (.java)
      ↓
Compiler (javac) [JDK]
      ↓
Bytecode (.class)
      ↓
Class Loader [JRE]
      ↓
JVM Execution [JRE]
      ↓
Machine Code

 
Remember:
 
• JDK ⊃ JRE ⊃ JVM
• JDK is for development
• JRE is for running applications
• JVM is for executing bytecode

Relationship
 
6. JDK contains JRE
7. JRE contains JVM
8. JDK > JRE > JVM (hierarchy)
9. JDK is for developers
10. JRE is for users
11. JVM is for program execution
 
Execution Flow
 
12. Source code (.java) written by developer
13. Compiler (javac) converts to bytecode (.class)
14. Bytecode loaded by ClassLoader
15. JVM executes the bytecode
16. Program runs on the machine


--------------------------------------------


JVM consists of a few memory storages as mentioned below:
1. Class(Method) Area: stores class-level data of every class such as the runtime constant pool, field, and method data, and the code for methods.
2. Heap: Objects are created or objects are stored. It is used to allocate memory to objects during run time.
3. Stack: stores data and partial results which will be needed while returning value for method and performing dynamic linking
4. Program Counter Register: stores the address of the Java virtual machine instruction currently being executed.
5. Native Method Stack: stores all the native methods used in the application.


The Java ClassLoader is an integral part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that dynamically loads Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The Java run time system does not need to know about files and file systems because of classloaders. Java classes aren’t loaded into memory all at once, but when required by an application. At this point, the Java ClassLoader is called by the JRE, and these ClassLoaders load classes into memory dynamically.
