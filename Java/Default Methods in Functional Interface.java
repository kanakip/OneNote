In Java, a default method is a method inside an interface that has a default implementation. It was introduced in Java 8 to allow interfaces to have methods with implementations without breaking existing code.
Why Default Methods?
Before Java 8, interfaces could only have abstract methods, meaning every implementing class had to provide its own implementation. Default methods help:
	â€¢ Add new functionality to interfaces without affecting existing implementations.
	â€¢ Provide backward compatibility for older interfaces.
	â€¢ Reduce boilerplate code in implementing classes.

 Example:
interface MyInterface {
    default void show() { // Default method
        System.out.println("Default Method Executed");
    }
}

class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    // No need to override the default method unless required
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.show(); // Calls the default method
    }
}

Output:
Default Method Executed
Key Points:
	â€¢ Default methods must be declared with the default keyword.
	â€¢ They can be overridden in implementing classes.
	â€¢ They help avoid breaking changes when modifying interfaces.
	â€¢ They cannot be used in abstract classes.
