11. What will happen if we declare don’t declare the main as static?
We can declare the main method without using static and without getting any errors. But, the main method will not be treated as the entry point to the application or the program.
Why ?
Let me explain why the main method must be declared as static in Java:
 
1. JVM Requirement
 
• The main method must be static because JVM needs to call it without creating an instance of the class
• When Java program starts, no objects exist yet
• Static methods can be called without object instantiation
 
2. Without Static Main
 
public class Example {
    // Non-static main - Won't work as entry point
    public void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}
Output: There will be no output. Instead, you'll get a runtime error.
		 
What happens when you try to run this code:
 
	1. Compilation:
	• The code will compile successfully
	• No compilation errors will be shown
	2. Runtime:
	• You'll get an error message similar to:

Error: Main method not found in class Example
Please define the main method as:
public static void main(String[] args)
 
3. Correct Static Main

public class Example {
    // Correct declaration - Will work as entry point
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}
 
4. Why It Won't Work Without Static
 
• To call a non-static method, you need an object
• To create an object, you need to call a constructor
• But who will create the first object?
• This creates a chicken-and-egg problem
 
5. Sequence of Program Start
 
JVM Start
   ↓
Load Class
   ↓
Look for static main
   ↓
Execute main method
   ↓
Create objects if needed

 
Therefore:
 
• Main must be static to serve as the entry point
• JVM can call static methods without object creation
• Non-static main will compile but won't be recognized as the program entry point
• It's part of Java's design specification
