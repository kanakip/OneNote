HTTP status codes indicate the result of a request made to a web server. They are grouped into five categories:

1xx - Informational
- 100 Continue â€“ The server received the request and is processing it.
- 101 Switching Protocols â€“ The server is switching protocols as requested.

  2xx - Success
- 200 OK â€“ The request was successful.
- 201 Created â€“ A new resource was successfully created.
- 204 No Content â€“ The request was successful, but there is no response body.

3xx - Redirection
- 301 Moved Permanently â€“ The requested resource has been permanently moved.
- 302 Found â€“ The resource is temporarily located elsewhere.
- 304 Not Modified â€“ The cached version of the resource is still valid.

4xx - Client Errors
- 400 Bad Request â€“ The request is malformed or invalid.
- 401 Unauthorized â€“ Authentication is required.
- 403 Forbidden â€“ The request is valid but access is denied.
- 404 Not Found â€“ The requested resource does not exist.

5xx - Server Errors
- 500 Internal Server Error â€“ A generic error occurred on the server.
- 502 Bad Gateway â€“ The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
- 503 Service Unavailable â€“ The server is temporarily unavailable.
