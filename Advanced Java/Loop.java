Certainly! Let's dive into the different types of for loops available in Java up to the latest JDK version. Java has evolved over time, introducing new loop constructs to make coding more efficient and readable. Here are the main types of for loops in Java:
 
1. Traditional for loop This is the most common and oldest type of for loop in Java.

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
 
2. Enhanced for loop (for-each loop) Introduced in Java 5, this loop is used to iterate over arrays and collections.987
 
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int num : numbers) {
    System.out.println(num);
}
 
3. Iterator-based for loop This is used with collections that implement the Iterable interface.

List<String> list = Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C");
for (Iterator<String> it = list.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {
    String item = it.next();
    System.out.println(item);
}
 
4. Labeled for loop This allows you to break or continue outer loops from within nested loops.

outerLoop:
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        if (i == 1 && j == 1) {
            break outerLoop;
        }
        System.out.println(i + " " + j);
    }
}
 
5. Infinite for loop -  This creates a loop that runs indefinitely until a break condition is met.
 
for (;;) {
    // Code to be executed
    if (someCondition) {
        break;
    }
}
 
6. For loop with multiple variables  - You can initialize and update multiple variables in a for loop.
 
for (int i = 0, j = 10; i < j; i++, j--) {
    System.out.println("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
}
 

7. Stream-based loops (Java 8+) While not strictly a "for loop", streams provide a functional way to iterate over collections.
 
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C");
list.forEach(item -> System.out.println(item));

OR list.forEach(System.out::println);
 
These cover the main types of for loops available in Java up to the latest JDK version. Each type has its own use cases and can make your code more efficient and readable when used appropriately.
