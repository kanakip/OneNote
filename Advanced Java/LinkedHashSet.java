It seems like you're asking about `LinkedHashSet`. Here’s a detailed explanation of `LinkedHashSet`:

What is `LinkedHashSet`?

`LinkedHashSet` is a class in Java that implements the `Set` interface and extends `HashSet`. It stores elements in a **hash table** with a **linked list** running through the elements, ensuring that the order in which elements were inserted is preserved. It does not allow duplicate elements.

Key Features of `LinkedHashSet`:
1. No Duplicates**: Like all sets, it does not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add a duplicate, it will be ignored.
2. Order Preservation**: Unlike `HashSet`, which does not guarantee any specific order of the elements, `LinkedHashSet` maintains the **insertion order**. This means that elements are returned in the order they were added.
3. Constant-Time Performance**: Insertion, removal, and lookup operations take **O(1)** time (constant time), like `HashSet`, because it uses a hash table internally.

When to Use `LinkedHashSet`?
- When you need to **eliminate duplicates** from a collection while **preserving the order** of elements.
- When you want fast access times similar to `HashSet` but also want to maintain insertion order.

Example:

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.LinkedHashSet;
public class loop1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Pallavi");
        list.add("Madhu");
        list.add("Pallavi");
        list.add("Uday");
        list.add("Pallavi");
        LinkedHashSet<String> lst = new LinkedHashSet<>(list);
        System.out.println(lst);
    }
}


Output:

[Pallavi, Madhu, Uday]



import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.LinkedHashSet;
public class loop1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add(13);
        list.add(1);
        list.add(98);
        list.add(94);
        list.add(94);
        LinkedHashSet<Integer> lst = new LinkedHashSet<>(list);
        System.out.println(lst);
    }
}
Output: 
[13, 1, 98, 94]




In this example, `"A"` was added twice, but the second `"A"` was ignored because `LinkedHashSet` doesn’t allow duplicates. The elements are printed in the **insertion order**.
